## 🚀 Phase 2: Digital Marketing (The "Zero Cost" Virality)

### 1. WhatsApp Marketing (Primary Channel)
Drivers live on WhatsApp. This is the #1 growth channel.

*   **Status/Story strategy:**
    *   Post a screenshot of a **generated GST Invoice** or a **Calculated Fare** with the caption:
        > "🔥 Generated professional bill in 10 seconds! No more writing on paper. Free app for drivers: sarathibook.com"
    *   Post daily "Tip of the Day" using the app (e.g., "Check how much profit I made today using Sarathi Book").

*   **Broadcast Lists:**
    *   Create a broadcast list of driver contacts.
    *   **Msg Template:**
        > "நண்பா, (Friend,)
        > Are you still writing bills by hand? ✍️
        > Try **Sarathi Book** - Free App for Cab Owners.
        > ✅ Calculate Fare (Round Trip/Drop)
        > ✅ Send PDF Invoice on WhatsApp
        > ✅ Track Expenses
        >
        > 👇 Install Free:
        > https://sarathibook.com"

### 2. Facebook Groups (High Volume)
Tamil Nadu has massive driver union groups on Facebook (e.g., "Chennai Call Taxi Drivers", "TamilNadu Tourism Drivers").

*   **Strategy:** Don't just spam links. Solve problems.
*   **Post Type 1 (The Question):**
    > "Brothers, which app are you using for GST bills? I found this new free website sarathibook.com, it's very fast for creating PDF receipts."
*   **Post Type 2 (The Value):**
    > "Share the fare calculation screenshot for a generic rote (e.g., Chennai to Trichy) and ask: 'Is this rate correct?' - Use the screenshot from Sarathi Book to subtly promote the tool."

### 3. YouTube Shorts / Reels (Visual Demo)
Drivers watch YouTube/Reels while waiting.

*   **Content Ideas:**
    *   "How to create a Cab Bill in 10 seconds" (Screen recording)
    *   "Round Trip Calculation - Correct Method vs Wrong Method"
    *   "Acting Driver Salary Calculation" (Use the Acting Driver Tool)
*   **Keywords:** `#TaxiDriver #Chennai #CabBusiness #SarathiBook #TamilNadu`

---

## 🚕 Phase 3: Physical Marketing (The Trust Builder)

### 1. QR Code Stickers
*   **Placement:** Inside the car (on the dashboard or behind the driver seat).
*   **Design:** "Need a Bill? I use **Sarathi Book**" or simply a "Digital Business Card" QR that links to their profile on Sarathi Book.
*   **Campaign:** Give free stickers to early adopters.

### 2. Visiting Cards
*   Print cheap visiting cards with the **Public Profile QR Code** (coming soon feature) on the back.
*   Distribute these at airports, railway stations, and hotel taxi stands.

---

## 🤝 Phase 4: Community & Partnerships (Scaling)

### 1. Taxi Stands & Unions
*   Visit major taxi stands (Airport, Central Station).
*   Demo the "Fare Calculator" to the *Union Leader* or key influencers at the stand.
*   If the leader uses it, everyone else will follow.

### 2. Travel Agencies
*   Small travel agencies struggle with professional billing.
*   Pitch Sarathi Book as a free tool for them to manage their attached vehicles.

---

## 📊 Phase 5: SEO Strategy (Long Term)

**Keywords to Target (mix of English & Tamil):**
1.  "Cab bill generator Tamil Nadu"
2.  "Taxi fare calculator Chennai"
3.  "Call taxi billing software free"
4.  "Driver daily collection app"
5.  "Acting driver salary calculator"

**Blog/Content:**
*   Create a simple blog page later (or use social media posts) answering common questions:
    *   "Current Driver Batta rates in TN"
    *   "How to calculate Round Trip Km"
    *   "Toll charges list 2024"

## 🏁 Measurement (Is it working?)
Track these metrics weekly:
1.  **New Signups:** (Check Supabase Auth users)
2.  **Invoices Created:** (Are users actually using the core feature?)
3.  **Returning Users:** (Are they coming back the next day?)
