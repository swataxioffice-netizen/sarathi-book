# Veo / AI Video Generation Prompts

Since you cannot record the screen directly, you can use these detailed text prompts in **Veo** (or similar AI video generation tools) to simulate the user flow.

For the best results, generate specific clips (shots) and stitch them together, as AI models often struggle to maintain perfect text/UI consistency over long sequences.

## Shot 1: Route Entry
**Prompt:**
> A high-quality, photorealistic close-up of a modern mobile app interface for cab booking. The design is sleek, using a white and royal blue color scheme. A user's finger taps the "Pickup" field and types "Pallavaram, Chennai". Then taps "Drop" and types "Madurai". A map in the background creates a blue route line connecting the two points. The text "Drop Trip" appears in a badge.

## Shot 2: Vehicle Selection (SUV)
**Prompt:**
> A mobile app screen showing a list of vehicles. The user selects "SUV (Innova/Ertiga)". The card highlights in blue. The price at the bottom of the screen updates instantly. The interface looks premium and responsive.

## Shot 3: Adding Extra Charges
**Prompt:**
> A close-up of the "Additional Charges" drawer sliding up on a mobile app. The user inputs "500" into a field labeled "Toll Charges". The total estimated price on the floating bottom card increases dynamically to reflect the added cost.

## Shot 4: Viewing the Price Card (Detail View)
**Prompt:**
> The user clicks a "View Detail" button on a floating price card at the bottom of a mobile app. The card gracefully expands upwards to fill the screen, revealing a detailed receipt-like breakdown. Items like "Base Fare", "Driver Bata", and "Toll Charges" are listed with their costs. A toggle switch for "Add GST (5%)" is turned on by the user.

## Shot 5: WhatsApp Sharing
**Prompt:**
> A "Share on WhatsApp" green button is pressed on a mobile app interface. The screen transitions to a WhatsApp chat view, where a pre-filled message with a detailed trip quotation and total price is ready to be sent. The message text is clear and formatted professionally.

## Tips for Veo Users
1.  **Style Consistency**: Add keywords like *"UI/UX design, 4k, clean interface, minimal design"* to every prompt to keep the look consistent.
2.  **Text Rendering**: GenAI video often garbles specific text. You might need to overlay the actual text (like "Pallavaram" or exact prices) in a video editor (like Premiere or CapCut) after generating the base UI interaction video.
